That's why we <b>need your feedback</b>, so please  <a href='{{surveylink}}'>fill in our survey</a>. Replying to just a few questions will make a huge difference.
<div style="font-size: small">
<p>PS: Instead of reading what follows, please <a href="{{surveylink}}">Fill in our survey !</a></p>	
	
<p>PPS: We'd like to raffle Ferraris, iPads etc... if you <a href="{{surveylink}}">fill in our survey</a>, but hmmm..., eerrr...., well... anyhow... what good would it be, since you shouldn't annotate while driving and NB doesn't work on the iPad yet?.. Rather <a href="{{surveylink}}">this is your chance</a> to make your voice heard about what you like and dislike about NB, and how you think we can improve it.
</p>
